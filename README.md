# Note Taker

# Description

This application is a note taking app. Users can create and save notes for all sorts of purposes. Each note has a title, text, and an id.

Once a user is finished editing a note, then they can save the note by clicking the save icon that appears in the upper right hand corner. All of the saved notes will appear on the left hand side.

If a user would like to delete a note, then they can click the trash can icon that appears in the left hand column, next to each note.

If a user would like to add another new note, then the user can click the plus icon to pull up a new note.

Future enhancements for development include the following:
-- add the ability to edit existing notes.
-- refactor the code so that the function writing the notes is in the /lib/notes.js file.
